  CLOSED: [2014-03-30 Sun 10:02]
  <2014-03-22 Sat>
  Probably a race.  The error means there are pending messages (either inbound
  or outbound) that need to be processed first.
  <2014-03-30 Sun>
  Also, the phone app will send two messages, one for weather and one for battery.
  It doesn't have a retry.
* DONE Send message to phone app to trigger weather/battery when watchface first loads
  CLOSED: [2014-03-30 Sun 10:02]
* For the phone app
* TODO Add controls for how often the watch should be updated

* Found a JS way to get some basic info from the phone without a phone app
  https://developer.getpebble.com/2/guides/javascript-guide.html
  Demos in PebbleSDK-2.0.2/PebbleSDK-2.x/Examples/pebblekit-js/weather
  and js-configure-demo
  Doesn't seem possible yet to get the phone's battery, even though there's a
  javascript way to do it.

  <2014-03-30 Sun> But, it seems flaky as hell.  Going back to using the phone app.
* TODO Figure out why the app crashes sometimes
