  Probably a race.  The error means there are pending messages (either inbound
  or outbound) that need to be processed first.

  Also, the phone app will send two messages, one for weather and one for battery.
  It doesn't have a retry.

  Demos in PebbleSDK-2.0.2/PebbleSDK-2.x/Examples/pebblekit-js/weather
  and js-configure-demo
  Doesn't seem possible yet to get the phone's battery, even though there's a
  javascript way to do it.

  <2014-03-30 Sun> But, it seems flaky as hell.  Going back to using the phone app.
